#Simple Charset


Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org)

##Description
Allows a simple override for the charset.  Still uses the sequential incrementing
(ie does not start this out with a fixed lenght ALA https://github.com/YOURLS/random-keywords)

I like to use the following as it

```
## SimpleCharSet https://github.com/giveforward/yourls-simplecharset
define('YOURLS_GFWD_CHARSET', '23456789bcdfghjkmnprstvwxyz');
```

##Installation
1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `simplecharset`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Plugins administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php` ) and activate the plugin.
4. Create your charset as a constant YOURLS_GFWD_CHARSET in user/config.php
5. Have fun!

##License
YOURLS' license, aka *"Do whatever the hell you want with it"*.
